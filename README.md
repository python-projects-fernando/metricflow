### What It Solves for You

You’re busy running your business—not analyzing data.  
Yet you need to know:  
- Are sales growing month over month?  
- What’s your average deal size?  
- How many new leads came in last week?

**MetricFlow gives you instant answers** from the data you already have—usually sitting in a simple CSV file.

Just upload it. Get a clean, visual dashboard. Make decisions with confidence.

### How It Works

2. **Upload it to MetricFlow**  
   One click. No sign-up. No setup.

3. **See your key metrics instantly**  
   - Total revenue  
   - Month-over-month growth  
   - Average transaction value  
   - New leads over time

### Built by Fernando Magalhães

Fernando is the author of two practical guides for developers who care about **building systems that last**:

- **[SOLID Principles in Python](https://a.co/d/4Zk6KGS)**: Learn to write maintainable, testable code through a real-world Clean Architecture project—no theory without practice.  
- **[Software Engineering – Essential Principles](https://a.co/d/fkU4hXH)**: A no-fluff guide to modern software craftsmanship, trusted by beginners and experienced engineers alike.

MetricFlow reflects that same philosophy: **simple on the surface, solid underneath**.
