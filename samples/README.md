These example files can be used to test MetricFlow with different scenarios:

### `basic_sales.csv`
- Simple sales and leads data
- Good for basic testing

### `multi_month.csv` 
- Data across multiple months
- Shows month-over-month growth calculation

### `with_pending_sales.csv`
- Includes pending sales (should not count toward revenue)
- Tests status filtering logic
